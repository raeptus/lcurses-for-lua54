the goal of this project is to simplify the build system for lcurses (https://github.com/lcurses/lcurses) and update it to Lua 5.4

tested on linux. should also work on windows through cygwin

documentation can be found at: https://lcurses.github.io/lcurses/


dependencies:
	- luarocks
	- gcc
	- ncurses (+ headers)
	- lua54 (+ headers)


build + install process:
	luarocks build


there are 4 things I had to change in the src/ directory:
	- in include/_helpers.c I have modified line 56, so that Lua 5.4 is supported
	- removed static declaration of strlcpy() in include/strlcpy.c line 44 and line 51
	- added config.h file
	- removed include/compat-5.2.c and include/compat-5.2.h, because they are not needed
